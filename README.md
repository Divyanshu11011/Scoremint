Introduction:

Welcome to the Evaluation Dashboard App - Mentor View! This project offers a comprehensive solution for mentors to evaluate students' performance during a semester-long project in college. In addition to traditional evaluation functionalities, this application integrates innovative features such as AI-driven chat for extracting useful information from uploaded PDF mark sheets and visualizing score data through **Pie Charts**.

Key Features:

1. **Student Assignment Management**: Mentors can add, edit, or remove students for evaluation, ensuring that each mentor can accommodate a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 4 students at a time. The system prevents two mentors from assigning the same student during the evaluation period.

2. **Mark Assignment with Visualization**: Mentors can assign marks to students across different evaluation parameters such as ideation, execution, and viva/pitch. Total marks are calculated and visualized using pie charts for both mentors and mentees to gain insights into student performance.

3. **AI-Driven Chat for PDF Interaction**: Mentors can upload downloaded PDF mark sheets and engage in AI-driven chat to extract useful information, facilitating efficient evaluation and mentorship.

4. **Final Submission and Locking**: Mentors can finalize their evaluations by submitting marks, after which they are locked and cannot be edited. Marks submission is only allowed if all students have been assigned marks.

5. **Viewing Students and Marks**: A dedicated view page allows mentors to filter students based on whether marks have been assigned or not, providing a clear overview of the evaluation progress.

Additional Features:

1. **Email Notifications**: Upon submission of evaluations, an email notification is sent to all assigned students, informing them that the evaluation process has been completed.

2. **Marksheet Generation**: Mentors can generate a marksheet in PDF or document format containing the evaluation details of all assigned students, aiding in record-keeping and sharing.

3. **Responsive Design**: The frontend of the application is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA) and ensures responsiveness across different devices.

Evaluation Criteria:

The Evaluation Dashboard App is meticulously crafted to meet all the basic requirements outlined in the project specifications. Both the frontend and backend components are implemented to fulfill the project requirements, emphasizing database schema design, code modularity, and overall code quality to ensure a robust and maintainable application.
